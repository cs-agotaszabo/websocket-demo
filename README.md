## Instructions

Assuming you have Node.js installed on your machine, just clone the repository and run `node server.js` or `npm start`.

Then open index.html in your browser. 

You shouldn't even need a web server, but I'd recommend using one anyway. If you have python installed it's just one command away, e.g.: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`. Then go to http://localhost:8080.
